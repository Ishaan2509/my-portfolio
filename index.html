          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            I’m a curious and motivated Computer Science student who enjoys
            turning ideas into real, working solutions. I like exploring how
            things work behind the scenes and constantly push myself to improve
            by learning new tools and technologies. I value clean design,
            efficiency, and clarity—both in code and in thinking. Beyond
            academics, I’ve gained confidence through projects, competitions,
            and collaborative work, which has shaped my ability to adapt, learn
            quickly, and contribute meaningfully to any team or challenge I take
            on.

          <h1>My Skills</h1>
          <p>
            I am a Computer Science student with strong problem-solving skills
            and a practical approach to learning. I have experience working with
            Python, C, SQL, HTML, CSS, and web technologies, and I enjoy
            building functional projects such as games, automation tools, and
            database-driven systems. I’m comfortable learning new tools quickly,
            writing clean and logical code, and breaking down complex problems
            into manageable solutions. Along with technical skills, I bring
            teamwork, communication, and leadership experience gained through
            hackathons, events, and volunteering, which helps me collaborate
            effectively and adapt in fast-paced environments.
