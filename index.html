        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
            I'm a Computer Science student with a strong interest in building practical, real-world tech solutions. I enjoy working with Python, C, SQL, and web technologies, and I’m constantly exploring new tools to improve my skills in software development and problem-solving.

I've worked on projects ranging from games and automation tools to database-based systems, and I enjoy turning ideas into functional applications. Alongside technical skills, I bring experience from events, competitions, and teamwork, which has helped me develop leadership, communication, and adaptability.

I'm always eager to learn, build, and grow as a developer.
